# 1 - COMPLETED WHOOP WHOOP :)
# connect to data source to extract OT data for transmission to the cloud repo

# 2 -
# organize the OT data into transmittable packets that can be stored in ascending time for plotting

# 3 - COMPLETED WOOHOOOOOO!!!!!!
# automatically increase/decrease the artifacts capacity to handle data volume

# 4
# demonstrate data packaging/unpackaging strategy

# 5 - COMPLETED
# Maximize data volume transferred speed per second, while minimizing latency

# find latency and bandwidth
